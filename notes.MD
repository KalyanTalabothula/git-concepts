## 🧠 Git Workflow Overview

| 📍 **Stage** | 🧭 **Meaning** | ⚙️ **Commands Involved** | 🧩 **Notes** |
|--------------|----------------|---------------------------|--------------|
| **Working Directory** | Where you edit files | `git status`, `git diff` | Untracked or modified files live here. |
| **Staging Area** | Prepare changes for commit | `git add`, `git reset` | Like a “Ready to save” zone. |
| **Local Repository** | Saved commits (local only) | `git commit`, `git log` | Stored in your `.git/` folder. |
| **Remote Repository** | Cloud copy (GitHub, etc.) | `git push`, `git pull`, `git fetch` | Shared repo accessible by others. |

## ⚙️ Technical Internals (Quick View)

| 🔧 **Action** | 🧩 **What Happens Inside Git** |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| `git add` | Adds file snapshots (SHA hashes) to **staging index**. |
| `git commit` | Creates a **commit object** linking to parent + file tree. |
| `git push` | Uploads commit objects to remote repository. |
| `git pull` | Runs `fetch` then `merge` your local branch. |
| `git reset` | Moves the **HEAD pointer** to another commit. |
| `git revert` | Creates a *new commit* that reverses previous changes. |
| `git stash` | Stores changes as a temporary diff in `.git/refs/stash`. |

## 🧩 Category Shortcuts

| 📚 **Category** | 🧠 **Commands** | 🪄 **Memory Trick** |
|------------------|----------------|---------------------|
| 🚀 **Start Project** | `git init`, `git clone` | “Start or copy project.” |
| ✍️ **Daily Work** | `git add`, `git commit`, `git status`, `git log` | “Track, Save, Check.” |
| 🌿 **Branching** | `git branch`, `git checkout`, `git switch`, `git merge`, `git rebase` | “Create, Jump, Combine.” |
| 🌍 **Remote** | `git push`, `git pull`, `git fetch`, `git remote -v` | “Sync with GitHub.” |
| 🧹 **Undo / Fix** | `git reset`, `git revert`, `git restore`, `git stash` | “Undo or clean safely.” |

### 🏁 Final Note:
> 📘 **Tip for Interviews:**  
> Always explain **what happens internally** (like “moves HEAD pointer” or “creates new commit”) — it shows strong Git knowledge.
